The idea I wanted to present with this assignment was a very personal one. I have always found interest in psychedelic themed art, movies and even music so I decided to make a project in the same theme.
It is meant to show that even the most random and unpredictable of things can also be the most beautiful ones, if we take the time to stop and reflect on what we see and how the everchanging details can be more impressive than most things we see.
